        Transitioning to Competitive Pokemon
    </h2>
    <p>
        Hello! Welcome to my guide. Competitive pokemon can seem daunting and wayyy too complicated for some. Trust me, I remember the time when I just started.
        I completely didn't understand why my pokemon were fainting, and struggled to remember pokemon type effectiveness. Not to worry, though! Let us embark
        on this journey together, where you won't start out clueless and alone like I was! This will give you an edge that will allow you to crush
        your opponents with ease >:)<br><br>
        In this guide, we will be going through the main differences 
        between regular and competitive pokemon and how to transition to competitive pokemon. Oh, and as a bonus just for you guys, I'll share some
        of the things I've learnt in this wonderful game, with its equally as wonderful community!

        <h3>
        The original game
        </h3>
    <p>
        Remember the fond memories from your childhood? The ones where you explored the region, challenged trainers and put together a team, handpicked
        from the large variety of pokemon in your region? Come, let's relive it together!
        <br>
        Which starter pokemon did you pick? I, for one, was a fire type abuser! Not that I'm proud of it or anything :)<br> I always picked the fire types
        in the games, whether it be charmander, chimchar or torchic. Speaking of which, here's my favourite final starter evolution in its mega form:

        The original game consists mainly of adventuring, catching pokemon and trainer battles. Items are usually hard to get
        and many good moves have to be taught to pokemon through Technical Machines(TMs) or Hidden Machines(HMs), which are similarly hard to get.

        <h3>
        Differences between the original game and Competitive
        </h3>
    <p>
        Competitive pokemon is, well, competitive. However, there are a lot of rules and restrictions for your preferred gamemode
        when it comes to competitive, which invites trainers to think out of the box and develop strategies essential to winning. These commonly
        used strategies and pokemon are called "meta". Some have defined meta as an acronym to mean "Most Effective Tactic Available", which helps
        in understanding the term, although it did not originate as an acronym.
