            Ok, now you feel like you're ready to start battling other trainers. You boot up your computer, crack your knuckles and hover your fingers
            over the keyboard when......<br>
            Stop. You realise you don't even know where to get started.

    <h2>
        Getting started
    </h2>
        <p>
            I was first introduced to competitive pokemon when I saw my friends playing PokemonShowdown on their phones(yes, you can play on your phone!). Let's take a look at some of the means through which you can play, and what to do
            when you enter your emulator of choice.
        </p>
    <h3>
        Competitive pokemon emulators
    </h3>
        <p>
            There are many notable competitive pokemon emulators out there, especially helpful if you do not own a nintendo console. The one which I personally use is
            <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com" target="_blank" class="link">PokemonShowdown!</a><br>
            You can click on the link and register for an account, but it is likely that you will be unsure of what to do after that, so for now, you can continue reading.
        </p>
    <h3>
        Competitive tiers
    </h3>
        <p>
            If you click the "format" button on the top left, you'll see a huge list of competitive tiers. Don't worry, though, as we'll be talking about them.
        </p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/2FvDXGF/format.png" alt="tier format" id="figure-3-1">
            <section class="figure-description">
                Figure 3.1, PokemonShowdown's competitive formats
            </section>
        <p>
            Most of the formats are either archived formats, or "for fun" formats that have wacky rules with hilarious and exciting gameplay. However, those only come into play
            when we understand how the main competitive tiers work, so we'll be focusing on those first. Competitive tiers are classed based on how
            good the pokemon are in competitive play.<br><br>For example, all pokemon can be used in the Ubers tier, but some pokemon that are considered too powerful are not allowed
            in the next best tier, Overused(OU). That doesn't mean that one tier is worse than another, it just means that at each tier, pokemon will be
            at or below a certain power level.<br>The main tier list, from top to bottom, is: Ubers, Overused(OU), Underused (UU), Rarelyused(RU) and Neverused(NU).<br>
            <a href="https://www.smogon.com/bw/articles/bw_tiers" target="_blank" class="link">This</a> is a good article I found that explains the tiers well. Take a look if you're interested :)
        </p>
    <h3>
        The first battle
    </h3>
        <p>
            Everyone's first battle will be confusing. Pokemon is a confusing game, with A TON of content to remember and take into account. Even so,
            let's slowly make our way over to the <u>Random Battle</u> format, and click battle. Just a warning, the music may be loud, so turn down your volume a bit!<br><br>
            The interface shouldn't look unfamiliar, it's just like the original games. To switch pokemon, all you have to do is click on your desired pokemon just below. It's that simple!
            However, having said that, you realise that your opponent is using moves you've never seen before. HOW does his <span class="type-icon type-dragon">dragon</span> type pokemon have
            a <span class="type-icon type-poison">poison</span> type move that OHKOs the <span class="type-icon type-fairy">fairy</span> type pokemon that I
            switched in to deal with him???<br><br>
        </p>
    <h3>
        Tips, tricks, advice and shenannigans
    </h3>
        <p>
            You've probably heard this countless times, but the best way to get better is by playing more. I know, I know, you're probably thinking something
            like "but there's just so much content I have to remember!" or "but I literally don't even know how to play the game!", I get it. We've
            all been through the starting stage and the best advice I have for you is to find a friend(or friends) who can guide you along as you progress,
            or just make friends online by playing the game! PokemonShowdown has these chat rooms that makes it easy to find people and even chat about
            stuff unrelated to pokemon.<br>
            After getting a feel of <u>Random Battle</u>, I recommend that you start building a team using the Teambuilder. For now, you don't have to
            worry much about a team composition, just put whatever pokemon that you've seen before and you like into your team. Try and get a feel of the
            different tier metagames. If you're not sure which metagame to start off with, try OU, the most popular metagame. However, I strongly recommend against
            going into Ubers first, because it holds the largest variety of pokemon and may be extremely confusing(if it wasn't confusing enough already, right?),
            so for now, you can explore the tiers.<br><br>
            I'll be listing some helpful commands you can use when you're in PokemonShowdown, if you decide to use it. You can find them in the "Terminology"
            section.<br><br>
            <span style="color: coral; font-size: 2rem;">Until then, all the best in your battles, trainer! Remember, your top priority is to HAVE FUN! :)</span>
