        About Competitive Pokemon
    </h1>
        <p>
            Competitive pokemon is complex, and may take a while to learn. You will not be able to put four moves on a pokemon and pick whatever sounds 
            cool, get away with it, and win the battle. Understanding the mechanics of pokemon in battle is crucial to be able to clutch victory from
            the grasp of the opponent. Every turn, every move you make is of utmost importance to be able to differentiate the good trainers from the best ones.
            That being said, there are some basics that you can learn before delving into competitive pokemon.
        </p>
</section>
<div class=mechanics>
    <h2>
        Gameplay mechanics
    </h2>
        <p>
            There are numerous game mechanics that factor into defeating your opponent. By understanding these, we can make the most optimal decision
            based on the situation that we are in. To defeat your opponent, you have to, of course, knock all their pokemon out by dealing damage to
            lower their HP to zero. Understanding how to effectively deal damage is one of the simplest yet hardest to master mechanic in pokemon.
            Since it is a mechanic that we are all familiar with, let's go through that first!
        </p>
<section class=type>
    <h3>
        Type
    </h3>
        <p>
            Each pokemon and move has a type. You may be familiar with the fire, water and grass types, and they each counter one another, similar to
            rock, paper and scissors. Here's an image for reference.
        </p>
            <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/pokemon_1stgen.jpg" alt="water beats fire, fire beats grass, grass beats water"

            </section>
        <p>
            Although this is a simple diagram of the effectiveness of the three starter types against each other, there are many more pokemon types.
            A chart of the type effectiveness of all the pokemon types looks something like this:
        </p>
            <img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/images/typechart.png" alt="complete type effectiveness chart" id="figure-2-2">
            <section class="figure-description">
                Figure 2.2, Complete type effectiveness chart by pokemondb.net
            </section>
        <p>
            Now, THIS looks mind boggling.<br>
            "How am I even supposed to remember all THAT?", you ask yourself. Well, fear not, we'll get back to that later. For now, we just have to
            focus on 3 things: Effectiveness, resistances and immunities.
        </p>
    <h4>
        Effectiveness
    </h4>
        <p>
            We all know that fire is super effective against grass. This means that the damage of a fire move against a grass type pokemon factors in the
            effectiveness of the move, which makes it 2x effective, essentially doubling the damage against the target.<br>
            Let's look at another example. Fire is super effective against bug type, which means that fire damage dealt is 2x against a bug type.<br>
            However, what happens when a pokemon with two types, grass and bug, is hit by a fire move? The grass/bug pokemon would recieve a whopping
            4x damage from the fire move! Type effectiveness is multiplicative, not additive, so since 2 multiplied by 2 is 4, we would say that the
            grass/bug pokemon is 4x weak to fire. This applies for resistances too. We'll get to that in the next section.
        </p>
            <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyomu8Pwuo1qa12hvo1_500.jpg" alt="It's super effective!" id="figure-2-3">
            <section class="figure-description">
                Figure 2.3, A flying type move being used against a fighting type pokemon
            </section>
        <p>
            A good trick to estimate damage is to multiply the move's power by the type effectiveness, then see if it can kill the pokemon. For example,
            if you just used Waterfall(80BP) to deal 40% HP regular damage, you essentially can use a move with the same 80BP to deal 80% HP damage to the same pokemon if you deal super effective damage. By the way,
            BP stands for Base Power. There's a "Terminology" page that you can check out later, but for now I'll make sure it's easy to understand.
        </p>
    <h4>
        Resistances
    </h4>
        <p>
            Resistances work the same way as effectiveness, except that it's just the opposite. It cuts the damage of uneffective attacks either by
            1/2 or by 1/4, depending on whether the pokemon is 2x resistant or 4x resistant respectively. Soaking up damage may not be as cool, flashy or exciting
            as OHKO-ing(One Hit Knock-Out) an opponent's pokemon, but it is vital in making sure that your own pokemon do not suffer that fate.
        </p>
    <h4>
        Immunities
    </h4>
        <p>
            Some pokemon types are immune to other types, meaning that they are not affected one bit. These interactions are fairly common,
            so it's something that you have to take into consideration. These are:<br><br>

            <section class="comment">
                Look at these cute pokemon type buttons by the way! I got inspiration for these from <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/steelix" target="_blank" class="link">pokemondb</a>, and
                if you click on them, you'll find the links to their pokemondb pages as well. 
            </section>
        <p>
            Although it may look like a lot to take in, you'll find that a majority of it makes perfect sense. Fighting can't hit ghost? Well, duh.
            Ground can't hit flying? Of course! Electric can't hit ground......you get the gist. 
        </p>
        <section class="fun-fact">
            
            Fun fact! Did you know that when the fairy type was introduced in gen 6, it was done largely out of consideration for dragon type? Back then,
            the dragon types were only weak against ice and other dragon types. A strategy involved selecting the dragon type move Outrage(120BP) on a high attack
            dragon type, which would then sweep entire teams because of its high attack stat. This proved to be extremely un-fun, and Game Freak promptly decided that enough was enough.

    <h3>
        Stats
    </h3>
        <p>
            Every pokemon has its own stats. Let's take a look at the stats of Charizard, for example. This was sourced from <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/charizard#dex-stats" target="_blank" class="link">pokemondb.net.</a>
        </p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mFgX9YJ/charizard-bst-pokemondb.png" alt="charizard stats" id="figure-2-4">
            <section class="figure-description">
                Figure 2.4, Charizard's base stats
            </section>
        <p>
            Each pokemon has all 6 stats: HP, Atk, Def, SpA, SpD and Speed. These are all abbreviations for the stats, in the same order that the picture shows stats.
            Each stat has its own unique role in a pokemon, and if you've ever played RPG or MOBA games, you might be familiar with a few of them. If not, fear not, that's why I'm here to explain! :D
            <br>
        </p>
    <h4>
        HP
    </h4>
        <p>
            HP is probably the simplest stat to understand. A pokemon's HP is just the number of hitpoints it has. For example, a 1000HP pokemon will most likely
            outlive a 500HP pokemon. There are a few other factors to consider, but for now we can just focus on the HP. A higher HP also means that %HP restoring moves,
            like Recover, would restore more HP, as Recover will restore 50% of a pokemon's max HP. However, it also means that moves like Giga Drain will absorb
            more HP from the pokemon, resulting in the pokemon who absorbed HP will have more HP.
        </p>
    <h4>
        Atk/SpA vs Def/SpD
    </h4>
        <p>
            The attack and special-attack stat is where things get fun. We can start by looking at Atk and SpA like Physical and Magic damage. They are both
            different forms of damage, but they do the same thing: deal damage. If you've ever played an RPG or MOBA game, you'll know that Physical damage targets
            a player's Armour values, and Magic damage targets Magic Resist values.<br> In pokemon, Atk targets Def values, and SpA targets SpD values. There are two types of damaging moves in pokemon: Physical and Special.
            Physical moves use Atk in damage calculation, and Special moves use SpA. Let's take a look
            at <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/steelix" target="_blank" class="link">Steelix's</a> stats:
        </p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/X4x1s9R/steelix-bst-pokemondb.png" alt="steelix stats" id="figure-2-5">
            <section class="figure-description">
                Figure 2.5, Steelix's base stats
            </section>
        <p>
            Wow! Look at that massive defense stat! Steelix takes Physical hits like a champ. However, since his SpD isn't that high, an appropriate strategy
            would be to use an attacker who can use Special damage to take Steelix down. 
        </p>
    <h4>
        Speed
    </h4>
        <p>
            Speed is the most underrated and unpopular stat for many players looking to transition to competitive pokemon. Many players do not understand
            how important speed is in closing out games. Speed is the stat that decides who goes first in a turn, simply decided based on which pokemon has a higher
            speed value.<br> Although it doesn't sound that important, it actually makes every turn you get have an advantage if you have a high speed. Having a high
            speed means that few pokemon can outspeed your pokemon. If you manage to boost your offensive stats with a high speed, it means that you are able to
            constantly OHKO any pokemon that comes into the battlefield, without caring about your defensive stats.
        </p>
    <h3>
        Stat changes
    </h3>
        <p>
            Pokemon's stats can be changed by moves, status effects or through other means, such as abilities. Stat changes play a crucial role in competitive pokemon,
            providing counterplay. At the same time, if you play around the possible counterplay, you will be able to set up your own pokemon for some
            big plays. 
        </p>
    <h4>
        Stat changing terminology
    </h4>
        <p>
            Each pokemon can be stat boosted in each stat(except HP) up to 6 stacks(also called stages). Each stack contributes 0.5x of a stat, and we call adding a stack +1. For example,
            a pokemon with +1 Atk will have 1.5x Atk, a pokemon with +2 Atk will have 2x Atk. A pokemon with +6 Atk at max stacks will have
            +6 Atk.<br>The only exceptions to this would be for evasion and accuracy, where each stack only contributes 0.33x of each stat.
        </p>
    <h4>
        Notable stat changing moves
    </h4>
        <p>
            There are many moves that can cause stat change, but notable ones are:<br><br>
            + Atk:<br>
            Swords dance(+2 Atk)<br>
            Dragon dance(+1 Atk, +1 Speed)<br>
            Belly drum(+6 Atk, -50% max HP)<br>
            Shell smash(+2 Atk, +2 SpA, +2 Speed, -1 Def, -1 SpD)<br><br>

            + SpA:<br>
            Nasty plot(+2 SpA)<br>
            Calm mind(+1 SpA, +1 SpD)<br>
            Quiver dance(+1 SpA, +1 SpD, +1 Speed)<br>
            Shell smash(+2 Atk, +2 SpA, +2 Speed, -1 Def, -1 SpD)<br>
        </p>
    <h4>
        Notable stat changing abilities/other factors that cause stat change
    </h4>
        <p>
            Notable abilities that can cause stat change are:<br><br>
            On KO(when the pokemon knocks out an opponent):<br>
            Chilling neigh(+1 Atk)<br>
            Grim neigh(+1 SpA)<br>
            Beast boost(+1 Highest Stat)(except HP)<br>
            Moxie(+1 Atk)<br><br>
            On switch-in:<br>
            Intimidate(target -1 Atk)<br><br>
            Status effects that cause stat change<span class="important">(VERY IMPORTANT!)</span>:<br>
            Burn(Halves Atk)<br>
            Paralysis(Halves Speed)<br>
            See the status effects section below for more info.
        </p>
    <h4>
            Same Type Attack Bonus(STAB)
    </h4>
        <p>
            When using a move that is the same type as its holder, the move's power gets multiplied by 1.5x! Surprisingly, more people than you'd expect do not know this.
            STAB is actually a very important factor in calculating damage, especially if it is neutral damage. The move with the higher power does not always deal the most
            damage, so do factor STAB in when estimating damage!
        </p>
    <h4>
        EVs and IVs
    </h4>
        <p>
            A pokemon's base stats can be naturally improved through EVs and IVs. IVs are automatically generated on birth, so we don't really
            have to worry about them as in competitive, we can set them as the highest value, 31 for each stat. However, managing EVs are when it starts to get interesting.
            A pokemon can achieve a maximum of 508 EVs, and can invest a maximum of 252 EVs in each stat.
        </p>

            </section>
        <p>
            Look at this guy. Isn't he just so cute? This is garchomp, one of my favourite pokemon. We'll be using him for our example here.
        </p>

            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/HpfFkRM/garchomp-invested-bst-pokemonshowdown.png" alt="garchomp invested stats" id="figure-2-8">
            <section class="figure-description">
                Figure 2.8, Garchomp's EV invested stats
            </section>
        <p>
            Since a pokemon has a maximum of 508 EVs, this means that a pokemon can fully invest two stats, and leave 4 EVs to put into another stat. Generally, this two stat investment is what
            most pokemon benefit from, however, there are exceptions that I won't get into.<br>
            If we look at the pictures above, we can see that investing EVs into the Atk and Speed stat does make a difference on our Garchomp. What if
            I told you we could increase the stats even more?
        </p>
    <h4>
        Natures
    </h4>
        <p>
            Every pokemon has access to all natures. A nature is a personality trait of a pokemon(adamant, modest, jolly etc.) that raises one of the stats of the pokemon by 10%,
            but lowers another stat by 10%. Let's take a look at the Garchomp from before.
        </p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/RchCY31/garchomp-nature-invested-bst-pokemonshowdown.png" alt="garchomp nature invested stats" id="figure-2-9">
            <section class="figure-description">
            Figure 2.9, Garchomp's EV and Adamant nature invested stats
            </section>
        <p>
            Just look at the difference. Garchomp now has a whopping 394 Atk! Compare that to our uninvested and invested stats, and you'll see just how much
            of a difference EVs and nature can make.<br>In this case, we used an Adamant nature on the garchomp(+Atk -SpA) to maximise the use of our nature.
            Since garchomp is a physical attacker because of its high Atk stat, we should only teach it physical moves. Without the use of any special move,
            our garchomp's SpA simply doesn't matter because it will not be used for anything at all.

            All pokemon can be afflicted with status effects. However, some are immune to their own kind of status effects. For example, an electric
            type cannot be paralysed, a poison type cannot be poisoned, a grass type cannot be afflicted by powder moves etc.

            There are two types of
            status effects: volatile and non volatile.
        </p>
    <h4>
        Volatile status effects
    </h4>
        <p>
            Volatile status effects will go away after a while, and do not count towards moves like Hex, where it has different effects if the target is
            afflicted with a non-volatile(major) status effect. Some examples of volatile status effects include:<br><br>
            Confusion. A confused pokemon has a 33% chance to hurt itself instead of executing the selected move.<br>
            Flinch. A pokemon who flinches cannot do anything.<br>
            Taunt. A taunted pokemon cannot execute non-damaging moves like recover, toxic etc.<br>
        </p>
    <h4>
        Non-volatile(major) status effects
    </h4>
        <p>
            Non-volatile status effects are what most of us are familiar with. Poison, burn, paralysis are some examples and their effects are very
            obvious and easy to understand. However, there are some hidden effects that status effects have that we may not know about. For example:<br><br>
            <span class="type-icon type-fire" style="width: 3rem;">Burn</span> removes 1/8 max HP per turn, but also halves Atk stat. This includes all stat changes, so if a pokemon has been boosted to 1000Atk, the pokemon will have 500Atk if it is burnt.<br>
            <span class="type-icon type-electric" style="width: 4.6rem;">Paralysis</span> gives a 25% chance of being paralyzed, but also halves Speed stat. It has the same logic as burn, so it halves the post-modifier Speed stat.<br><br>
            Since non-volatile status effects still persist even when the pokemon is switched out, it is a great way to hinder strong physical attackers
            in the opponent's team and render fast, annoying pokemon vulnerable to attacks.<br><br>
            Some other great status effects to take note of are:<br><br>
            <span class="type-icon type-poison" style="width: 4rem;">Poison</span> removes 1/8 max HP per turn.<br>
            <span class="type-icon type-poison" style="width: 7.6rem;">Badly poisoned</span> pokemon get 1/16 max HP removed on the first turn, but it increases by 1/16 max HP on subsequent turns, per turn.
            This means that on turn 1, 1/16 max HP is removed. On turn 2, 2/16(which is 1/8) max HP is removed. On turn 3, 3/16 max HP is removed etc.
